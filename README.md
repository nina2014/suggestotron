A voting system for you and your friends to play with.

To teach you Ruby on Rails we are going to use a "Real World" example. You've decided to create a voting system for you and your friends to play with. You've decided at a minimum, you'd like to allow users to:

  view the topics sorted by number of votes,
  vote on topics,
  create, edit, and destroy topics
